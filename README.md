# Quantum Random Number Generator

This project implements a quantum random number generator using Qiskit, IBM's quantum computing framework. The program simulates quantum circuits to generate truly random numbers based on quantum mechanical principles.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Qiskit
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the program using:
```bash
python quantum_random.py
```

### Features

The program generates Lotto Max numbers using quantum randomness:
- Generates 7 unique numbers between 1 and 50
- Uses quantum circuit simulation for true randomness
- Numbers are sorted and formatted for easy reading

### Sample Output

```
üé∞ Quantum Lotto Max Number Generator üé∞

Generating Lotto Max numbers (7 unique numbers from 1-50):
-------------------------------------------------------
Your quantum-generated numbers: 03 - 17 - 25 - 31 - 42 - 45 - 49

Note: These numbers are generated using true quantum randomness simulation!
Good luck! üçÄ
```

### How it Works

The program uses quantum superposition to generate random numbers:

1. Creates a quantum circuit with 6 qubits (needed to represent numbers up to 50)
2. Applies Hadamard gates to put each qubit in superposition
3. Measures the qubits, causing them to collapse to either 0 or 1
4. Converts the resulting binary string to a decimal number
5. Ensures numbers are within the valid range (1-50) and unique
6. Sorts the numbers for consistent display
